Overview:
This project models a functional small office network using Packet Tracer, including router, switch, DHCP, DNS, and end devices.

Key Components:
- Configured DHCP scopes, DNS records, and IP addressing.
- Designed a network diagram with routers, switches, and clients.
- Simulated common network failures: DNS outages, IP conflicts, gateway misconfigurations. - Created a professional troubleshooting guide with command outputs.
  
Skills Demonstrated:
- TCP/IP fundamentals
- DNS & DHCP configuration
- Network troubleshooting (ping, tracert, nslookup) - Network design & documentation


# Lets start by Building the Small Office Network

So here is where we are goimng to grab our router, switch, DHCP, DNS, and end devices and connect them using our cables aswell.

 
So let start with our router and switch

for your router we  are using 2911 model

For your switch we are using 2960

After that lets go to our end devices and grab out PCs and Servers

Grab and layout your PCs 0-5 and both Servers DHCP and DNS

Once all devices have been added ... now lets connect them together to create the network 



Let's use the auto connector which looks like a lighting bolt connecting the severs and PCs to the switch.

Now for to  connect the router to the switch we wil have to use the straight though cable. 



# Configuring the devices on the network

Lets do the router first
